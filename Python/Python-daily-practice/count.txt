Liu revealed this plan on the JDDiscovery conference jointly held by JD Finance, the finance arm of JD.com, and leading venture capital firm Sequoia Capital. He added that the earliest trials of using such delivery robots within campuses of Tsinghua University and Renmin University dated back to as early as almost one year ago.

The robot Liu referred to is a small "driverless vehicle" that delivers parcels from a JD-pai, an on-campus logistics and experience center, to a location where a student could pick up his or her parcel after receiving a text message, a public relation employee surnamed Yang told chinadaily.com.cn on Tuesday.

Liu said at the conference that he hopes JD's development of artificial intelligence will not make its employees lose their jobs but make them do "better jobs", in addition to enabling each industry to improve efficiency, cut costs and improve consumer experience.

"I hope one day, my brothers do not need to go to the street to deliver goods under the burning sun, or bracing the cold wind or the heavy snow or the smog and they could just sit in offices, monitoring millions of drones, delivery robots, 800 logistics centers, tens of thousands of driverless vehicles and 20,000 to 30,000 unmanned delivery centers.
